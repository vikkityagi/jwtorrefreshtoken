Step 1: First register the user with json body

Expected Response:

 {
  "username": "vikki",
  "password": "12345"
}


step 2: Now login the user again

with this payload {
  "username": "vikki",
  "password": "12345"
}


it's give you a response: token or refreshtoken

step3: Get register user with send the Bearer token in authorization

then it give the user body or invalid or expired token but if refresh token is still valid then 
you can call the /refresh token api with payload

 {
    "token":"e55c0508-e81f-4578-800f-6a09cecb4c48" -- (this refresh token is similar of got refresh token at the time of login)
}


step 4: if refresh token is valid then it can give new token or refresh token you can get the users again through the new bearer token
